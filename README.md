# DarkMatterJS
DarkMatter is a truly customizable ReactJS UI-Library and React and ReactNative framework created to help developers rapidly create **unique** and **custom** applications.

## Why DarkMatter?
Use DarkMatter to quickly design, scaffold and launch your own full-stack web application, micro-service architected API, and react-native iOS/Android applications.

## What DarkMatter Isn’t
DarkMatter isn’t the final product, nor is it a sellable product to clients. However, DarkMatter is intended to help jump start your development, so that you don’t have to start from scratch every time. We’ve done the initial work, you can get into the hardcore coding that makes your app unique - but built in a flexible system so you can customize.

DarkMatterUI also isn’t a UI-framework that you can just use without thinking about design. We didn’t want to build just another UI library that just looks like everyone else (like Foundation,  Bootstrap, Material Design… you get the point). However, if you aren’t a designer, that’s ok - we’ve created many preconfigured themes for you, that are still customizable. 

## Need to Know
NodeJS, Babel, Docker, Nginx, ReactJS, ReactNative, and maybe Sketch.


## What’s Included?

### DarkMatter Sketch Designs

### DarkMatter Micro-Service Architecture API
Micro-services don’t have to be complicated. We help you launch your own customizable backend infrastructure, but with the flexibility of adding in robust micro-services. Use some our “out-of-the-box” services, 3rd party add-ons, or create your own.
